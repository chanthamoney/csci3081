Question 1:
Attempting to print var_a_ and var_b_ will result in a compliation error, which seems reasonable. Briefly explain why it doesn't
compile?
We did not declare var_a_ and var_b_ in the scope.
If we uncomment int var_b_ and int var_a_ in the
protected and private we can compile.

Question 2: The ComposedClass contains an ObjectClass object to which var_a_ and var_b_ belong,
 and yet when you try to print them out, those lines will not compile.
Briefly explain why.
For our context, those variables are private and not have been inherited from the Object class.
We need to inherit it.

Question 3: ComposedClass probably needs to interact with object_ members. how will you give
ComposedClass access?
Make it a friend?
